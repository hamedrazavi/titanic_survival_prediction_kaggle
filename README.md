# titanic_survival_prediction_kaggle
This is a basic Kaggle competition project. The presented kernel is ranked in top 3% of more than 11000 kaggle participants. I will use Python and Scikit-learn libraries to predict survival of Titanic passengers given the features such as gender, social class, etc. 
You can get the data (train.csv, test.csv) and description of the features here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data
